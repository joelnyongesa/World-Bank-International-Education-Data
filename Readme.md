# Analyzing World Bank Educatio Data.
In this exercise, I use SQL to perform an INNER JOIN on two tables: `international_education` and `country_summary` based on a common column: *country_code*.

After joining the two tables, I use several SQL functions to calculate the average education value per region, sorting the results in descending order.
